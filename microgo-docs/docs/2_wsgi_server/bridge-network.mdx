# Bridge network

Greatest changes come from the networking setup. In the previous setup, we exposes all of our app to `host` network. But in this section, we will construct an internal bridge network (See **[Docker networking](/docs/tutorial-basics/docker-network)** for more info ðŸ‘€)

The bridge network helps:
- Bridge network maps the container's IP to a route table. This helps multiple containers to open to the same port
- Keep track of scaled services since Docker will assign the services to a range of IPs 

### Change the host name
The first change need to be done when migrating from host network to bridge network is the change from `localhost` -> `<service name>`

MARIADB_HOST="mariadb"
MONGO_HOST= "mongodb"
