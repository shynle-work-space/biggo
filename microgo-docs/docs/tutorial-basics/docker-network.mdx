# Docker networking

List the network name using the command: `docker network ls`

Scope `local` means that the IP address of the network can only be referred by namespaces inside of Docker. 
When develop an application that not hosted by a container, you must explicitly specify the IP address of each container

## Host network

Host network is the closest development experience. We install a bunch of software using containers, and refer to them as `localhost`.
Every port open in the application will be open directly to Docker. There is no fuse going on in terms of networking. 
This could mean that conflicted port maybe arises when multiple application try to open the same port

To implement host networking in `docker-compose.yml`

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:4.4.18
// highlight-start
    network_mode: host
// highlight-end
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb:latest
// highlight-start
    network_mode: host
// highlight-end
```
