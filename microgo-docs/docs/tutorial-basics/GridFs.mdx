# Store large binary with GridFS

To store large binary files in MongoDB, we use GridGFS. 
GridFS is a create way to store static files generated by user by splitting the files into smaller bits.

GridFS creates two collections whem using GridFS: `fs.files` and `fs.chunks`

- `fs.files` contains the ObjectID of files, as well as the metadata of the files
- `fs.chunks` contains the actual bits of static files

When dealing with GridFS, it is a good idea to query the file and metadata using the `fs.files` collection, then download them using the `gridfs` module
