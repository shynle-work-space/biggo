# Brief explanation

## Databases

Databases will be create by docker composes. Both databases will using host network (so that the Flask server can connect via `localhost`)

We will utilize the `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` to create the databases, tables and collections of the two databases. This seeding is placed in [bootstrap folder](https://github.com/highlander-spirou/microgo/tree/2_Celery_worker/bootstrap).
In production, this will be created seperately, since this contains confidential data like access user and access password.

In [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/highlander-spirou/microgo/blob/2_Celery_worker/docker-compose.yml), 
we utilize the `.env` file to manage secrets. Review the [.env.example](https://github.com/highlander-spirou/microgo/blob/2_Celery_worker/celery-app/.env.example)
for the keys required. 

We also specify the `network_mode` to be `host` so that the IP address of the containers will be mapped directly to docker's localhost.

## Monolith server

### Coding style

The web framework is written in `Flask`, and the image processing use `PIL`. The project is managed by `Poetry`.

Flask application will be written in `controller` style:

- `lib`: Include reusable code (JWT, access to MongoDB, errors, ...). This file will be installed as global dependency by `Poetry`
- `controllers`: Contains the main logic of the routes. Controller responsibility is to execute the logic and return either Data or Error class with appropriate message
- `index.py`: Route declaration and JSON response (message from controller and status code)
- `wsgi.py`: Import `app` from `index.py`
- `config.py`: Global variables and environment variables
- `instantiation.py`: Instantiate lib's class with config from `config.py`

Poetry will create a symlink between the `lib` folder to the global `site-packages` in the environment. To install the modules from `lib` folder with poetry, includes

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.poetry]
...
packages = [
    { include = "auth", from="lib" },
    { include = "errors", from="lib" },
    { include = "file_access", from="lib" },

]
```
