# Code Overview

![Flask warning](/img/flask-warning.png)

Flask development server is built on Werkzeug, which is limited and tied to a single proccess. 
To be able to run Flask concurrently (and efficiently), we implement a `Gunicorn` wsgi server, that can scale Flask upto *(2\*CPU)+1* times.

#### But there comes a problem !!!

In development, we have absolute control of the server. If we scale the server up (3 times perhaps), now the identifying, debuging (or maybe descaling) becomes much harder.
Here comes ‚≠ê**Logging**‚≠ê

## Python logging

Some say writing log is the different between a developer and a good developer, and I agree üòé. Log is tedious, and we spend lots of times to maintain (the same as testing),
however, writing log is the shield protecting our application from being a total melt down. Especially in a distributed system (as we are plan to build), 
we want to log as much as possible to identify bottleneck, problems and how to tackle them.

Python already have a quite good module for simple logging. For more information check out the tutorial: [Python logging module](/docs/tutorial-basics/python-logging).
Here, we just walkthrough the changes in the codebase
