## Core k8s workflow

1. When setting up `kubectl`, the developers require to connect to a k8s cluster. In minikube, the kubectl is automatically configured.

We can view all the connected k8s with command

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

We also can connect `kubectl` with GCP, view **[This tutorial](https://sunitc.dev/2020/12/12/how-to-create-first-kubernetes-cluster-on-google-cloud-and-connect-to-it-from-local-machine-using-kubectl/)**


2. K8s developers write *ymls* that describe the desired state of the k8s application (what containers should ran, how networking should works, ...) then apply the changes to `kubectl`

3. `kubectl` send commands to the master node. Base on the desired state, the master node(s) controls the worker node(s) to match the desired statement.
